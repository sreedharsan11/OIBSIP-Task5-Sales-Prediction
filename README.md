# Task 5 - Sales Prediction using Python

This project is part of my Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship.  
The goal of this task is to predict product sales based on advertising budgets using a regression model.

### Objective
To build a machine learning model that can predict sales based on the amount spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Steps Involved
1. Loaded the dataset and performed data exploration.
2. Visualized correlations between advertising channels and sales.
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluated model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error.
6. Created a scatter plot comparing actual and predicted sales.
7. Predicted sales for a custom advertising input.

### Results
- The model achieved a high R² score (around 0.9).
- Strong positive correlation between TV/Radio spending and Sales.
- The model can be used to estimate future sales for given ad budgets.
